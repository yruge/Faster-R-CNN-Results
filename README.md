# Faster R-CNN Object Detection on VOC 2007

This project is an implementation of the **Faster R-CNN** model for object detection, trained on the **PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset**.

## Project Summary

The goal of this project was to train a computer vision model to accurately detect and classify objects in images. The model was trained to identify the 20 object classes present in the VOC 2007 dataset.

## Results

After training, the model achieved the following performance on the test set:

* **Mean Average Precision (mAP):** 44.3%

## Notes
A better result was once achieved up to 62% mAP score, but was lost due to technical issues.
